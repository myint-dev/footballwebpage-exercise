      <h2>The Beautiful Game</h2>
      <p>
        Football is more than just a sport. It’s about passion, strategy, 
        teamwork, and inspiration. Every match tells a story.

      <h2>My Love for Football</h2>
      <p>
        Football attracts people of all backgrounds and interests. For me, 
        the game is not only about watching matches but also about the 
        comprehensive approach behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most fans have their favorite team or player. For example, I admire 
        Andrea Bertea, the new Sporting Director at Arsenal. He is a smart 
        leader who manages strong personalities at the club alongside the 
        head coach. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertea also played as a forward (No.9) and now uses his experience 
        in recruitment and building relationships with stakeholders. It is 
        not an easy task in the modern football environment, and that’s why 
        I respect his work.
