      <h2>The Beautiful Game</h2>
      <p>
        Football is more than just a sport. It's about passion, rivalry, 
        and strategy — whether in the Premier League or UEFA competitions.

      <h2>Why I Love Football</h2>
      <p>
        Football attracts millions of fans worldwide because it combines 
        skill, drama, and unity. For me, it's not just about the matches 
        on the pitch but also the stories and strategies behind the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I admire the strategies of sporting directors who build teams not only by signing stars,
        but by creating balance and long-term vision.
        People like Andrea Berta at Arsenal show how recruitment can be more about 
        intelligence, patience, and fit rather than just money.

        Watching UK based clubs clash in the Premier League or UEFA 
        Champions League is a reminder of how football blends tactics, 
        leadership, and raw emotion.

    <h2>Andrea Berta – The Strategist</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike many football directors, Andrea Berta never had a professional 
      playing career. He began in banking at the Mairano branch of BCC di 
      Pompiano before moving into football administration. His journey started 
      in 1999 at amateur club Carpenedolo, where he was hired purely for his 
      deep football knowledge at age 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known as a “football nerd,” shy and humble, Berta focuses on strategy, 
      scouting, and club building. His story proves that one can reach the 
      top of football not by playing but through intelligence and vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Berta has made an immediate impact since joining Arsenal as Sporting Director, 
      transforming the squad with a bold and data-driven transfer strategy. In his first 
      transfer window, he oversaw a <strong>£267 million investment in seven new players</strong>, 
      including high-profile signings such as <em>Eberechi Eze, Viktor Gyökeres, Martin Zubimendi, 
      and Noni Madueke</em>. This decisive approach has been praised as one of the most 
      ambitious squad overhauls in recent Premier League history.

    <h2>Premier League & UEFA Competitions</h2>
    <p>
      The Premier League is one of the toughest domestic leagues in the world, 
      while UEFA competitions such as the Champions League bring together the 
      best clubs across Europe. Arsenal and Liverpool both use these platforms 
      to showcase their tactical approaches and international ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s Arsenal’s pursuit of returning to the top or Liverpool’s 
      dominance in European football, both clubs remind us why football is 
      the most beloved game worldwide.
